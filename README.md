# unnumberedtotoc

For standard classes, this package provides the commands `\addpart`, `\addchap` and
`\addsec`. Those typeset unnumbered sectioning levels *and* include them in the table of
contents and set up the running headers correctly. Starred versions are available as well,
which work like starred sectioning commands for the standard classes but clear the header.
